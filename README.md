### IPL Data Analysis :cricket_game:
With the rise of the Indian Premier League in 2008, cricket became a worldwide phenomenon as it continued to receive millions in viewership. As of 2019, the IPL has been valued at $6.7 billion. With so much at stake and every ball under scrutiny, technology is being used extensively to make the players plan and play better. This project was to analyze this large scale unstructured data and extract some useful information and solutions for the team management to identify the top players and assess the performances of the players and make the right choices in the upcoming seasons.

### ATLA Analysis 	:fire: :droplet: :tornado: :bricks:
“Avatar: The Last Air Bender” is one of the best-animated shows that I’ve ever seen. The avatar dataset on Kaggle was the best place to start experimenting on sentiment analysis. The real reason that I chose this dataset is to find out if “Honor” was the most said word by Zuko and for the memes obviously.  :wink: The dataset had all the dialogues spoken across all the 3 books. Some of it also included scene descriptions that had to be removed. So after a bit of preprocessing the dataset had about 9k rows.

### Search Algorithms with PacMan :full_moon::joystick:
This project was done for the fulfilment of the Artificial Intelligence course. Pac-Man is a retro game that involves a maze-like environment where a yellow, pie-shaped Pac-Man character, travels around the maze trying to eat dots and while avoiding four hunting ghosts. The maze-like environment makes it possible to test the various search algorithms while defining a winning condition. Thus in our project, we aim to compare various informed and uninformed search algorithms and compare their performances on various maze sizes and also study how various heuristic functions affect the performance of a search algorithmIn this project we are comparing the performance of Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth First Search(DFS), Uniform Cost Search(UCS), Bidirectional Search(BIS), and A* Search with Heuristics.

### Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Speed Estimation :red_car::motor_scooter:
This project was done for the fulfilment of the Digital Image Processing course. In a huge country like India with a high population on the roads and dangerous conditions, there is a need to automate a lot of functions to assist the traffic police. Hence, the function of calculating the speed of all vehicles that travel on the road becomes necessary. Due to the significant expense of radar and less precision, the radar system is not able to become popular in the traffic surveillance system. Therefore, we propose an image processing approach to calculate the speed of vehicles that are monitored through video cameras placed strategically
