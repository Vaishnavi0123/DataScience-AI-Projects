Pac-Man is a retro game that involves a maze-like environment where a yellow, pie-shaped
Pac-Man character, travels around the maze trying to eat dots and while avoiding four hunting
ghosts. The maze-like environment makes it possible to test the various search algorithms while
defining a winning condition. Thus in our project, we aim to compare various informed and
uninformed search algorithms and compare their performances on various maze sizes and also
study how various heuristic functions affect the performance of a search algorithm.
